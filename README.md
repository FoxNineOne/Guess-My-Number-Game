A simple number guessing game.

The computer will generate a hidden number that is between 1 and 20. 

You will need to enter a number to guess what the hidden number is. 
If your guess is too high or too low, this will appear on the screen. 

For every incorrect guess, you lose a point. When you run out of points, the screen will turn red and it will be game over.

If you guess correctly, the screen will turn green indicating victory. 
If your score is higher than the high score, this will be recorded in the bottom right of the screen.
